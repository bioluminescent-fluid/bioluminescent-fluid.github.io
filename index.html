                <h3>One: beginnings</h3>

                <div class="wrapper-prose">
                    <p>
                        This is the final project for the course <a href="https://www.kth.se/social/course/DH2323/">"Computer Graphics and Interaction"</a> by professor <a href="https://www.kth.se/profile/chpeters/">Cristopher Peters</a>, at <a href="https://www.kth.se/en">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally, Tiago thought about doing his project about fluid simulation, and Christine, about simulating bioluminescent plankton. Then we realized it would make sense to combine efforts and build a fluid simulation and bioluminescent particles simulation on top of it!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were inspired by Christine’s previous project called <a href="https://christinelupus.com/portfolio/absorb-water-and-light-insanity/">ABSORB</a>, which was all about creating an immersive experience exhibition centered around water and light. It really sparked something in us and made us want to explore the idea of animating glowing water in a new and unique way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After getting inspired, we started brainstorming ideas, and that's when we thought of it: bioluminescence! We thought it would be incredible to incorporate the natural phenomenon of bioluminescent organisms into the computer graphics project. We discussed the idea with the professor, who gave us some valuable advice. He suggested that using a particle system would be a relevant approach to achieve the desired effect. Additionally, we realized that we could take it up a notch by making the project touch-sensitive on a large screen, creating an interactive experience. This aspect excited us because we wanted to push the boundaries and engage the audience in a whole new way. Moreover, we decided to focus on the research aspect of the project to deepen our understanding and contribute to the existing knowledge.

                    <p>
                        To get started, we filled in the Specification Template provided by our professor. This helped us outline the key goals and requirements for the project. We wanted to ensure that we had a clear direction and a solid foundation to build upon. The template served as a great starting point and helped us organize our thoughts and ideas effectively. It was essential to lay the groundwork for the research and report.

                <h3>Three: technical inspirations</h3>

                        With out specification, we could start getting our hands "dirty". We looked up for implementations of Fluid Simulation, and found many interesting resources. Some very inspirational, but without much explanation, and others very didactic, with detailed explanations.
                        
                        <h4>Inspirational (fluid simulation)</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This is probably the most amazing implementation of fluid simulation for the Web: <a href="https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/">WebGL Fluid Simulation</a>
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <a href="https://www.memo.tv/works/msafluid/">A C++ / Java / AS3 library, by Memo Akten, that is popular with artists</a>, used and adapted in many installations and performances. Memo says his main example was inspired by the unfinished game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_Pong">Plasma Pong</a>, a version of Pong where the ball and paddles move through a fluid &mdash; which was frankly a super cool idea!
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>
                                Mike Ash actually based his implementation on Jos Stam's paper <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf">"Real-Time FLuid Dynamics for Games" (pdf)</a>, the root of most fluid simulation implementations out there, apparently.
